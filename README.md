# Aurebesh-DiscordBot
 
A simple discord bot that translates text to the Aurebesh language from Star Wars

Note: This edition (Java) of the bot is being abandon in favor of the [Javascript rewrite](https://github.com/Raymond-exe/Aurebesh-DiscordBot-JS). The JS version will be the new focus for all things related to this bot. 

**To use:** Simply type `||ab (text)||` and send to a text channel that the bot is able to read. 
*Note: The bot **must** have permissions to manage messages in that channel, in order to delete the original message that was sent.*
